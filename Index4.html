				<p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
					Football, also known as soccer, is a popular team sport played around the world. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by putting the ball into the opposing team's goal. Each team consists of eleven players, including a goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to use their hands and arms in the game. The rest of the players use their feet, legs, torso, and head to control and pass the ball. 
					Football is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The ball is moved up and down the field by dribbling, passing, and shooting. The game is divided into two halves, each lasting 45 minutes. If both teams have the same number of goals at the end of the game, it is considered a draw. 
					Football is a sport that requires physical fitness, skill, and teamwork. It is watched and beloved by millions of fans around the world, and is played at both amateur and professional levels. Major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Champions League bring together the best teams from around the world to compete for the ultimate prize in football.
